i changed the Research...Thesis122127.docx thesis to the thesis.pdf, i trained the plant disease model and changed the focus of the thesis as discussed with the clinet. 
but then the client is skeptical because his advisor told him:
            "As we talked about last time,when i went to my advisor again,he was out of country for work.He arrived the day before yesterday on saturday.
            When i talked to him today,he said"First of all,the title should not be changed,as it was before."
            then he said,"Edit what needs to be edited starting from page one."..

and this is his critic "Example: let you start chapter one:-Contents
                          Background ot the study page 7,8,9,10......(the cite  is set but not references)
                          The proposed system should be clearly written and the  architecture should be formaly and clearly designed .
                          Problem of the statement also ...1,7,35 what the references for this."..the scope is changed now since the IOT tools are not available nor the drones. the project now is plant diseases detection in real time but also the title of the initial thesis must be the same and the contents must complement each other like best of both worlds but the goal is the final thesis(pdf). so what changes should i make?
